## Installation

Make sure you're on Node 18+

To run the app locally, first you need to install Expo Go from the App Store (or Android Store).
Then git clone, and run

```
yarn && npx expo start
```

Then scan the QR code provided and it will build the app on your device.

**Note**: You will need the `lyf-api` service running for the local version to work properly! That can be [installed here](https://github.com/Lyf-Planner/lyf-api)

## Contributions

Tasks to contribute to Lyf Mobile are defined in the [Lyf Mobile Jira](https://lyf-planner.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/LM/boards/8/backlog?versions=visible). If you wish to make a contribution, you can

- Select a task from the version closest to the current one (found in `package.json`)
- Set yourself as the Assignee
- Checkout a branch from main, whose name should be that of the ticket (e.g. `git checkout -b LM-13`)
- Consult @ethanhusband about the changes to be made / you intend to make
  - Request the .env file if you don't have it already
- When the changes are complete and tested, make a PR to `main` branch and await review

#### Common Errors

- `non-std c++ expression`
  - Happens when the Expo cache has a state error. Not caused by anything we do - just run `npx expo start -c` to restart and clear the cache

## Deployments

Deployments are handled via Expo Application Services, and can all be delegated to @ethanhusband.

The live version of the app can be seen on the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/lyf/id6470702288). Currently the app is not available on Google Play store.
